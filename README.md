  <summary>What is the purpose of authorization code in OAuth</summary>
  <br/>
  
  It's possible to do it with a single request - it's called the _**implicit flow**_ then.
  
  The general idea of using access code (authorization flow) instead of directly returning the tokens is to **hide** them from the end user. The second request is done usually by the backend server instead of a browser.
